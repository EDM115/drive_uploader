# Google Drive Uploader Telegram Bot
**A Telegram bot to upload files from Telegram or Direct links to Google Drive.**\
~~Find it on Telegram as [Google Drive Uploader](https://t.me/gdriveruploadtd_bot)~~


**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS IS A FORK, THE ORIGINAL REPO IS [HERE](https://github.com/kjeymax/GDUPLOAD_BOT2)**
**Still kinda bugged, some files don't upload, no confirmation/error messages, some cloning fails. Wait for a better update before forking üòâ**  

### <u>Bugs noted out (they needs fix) :</u>
- [ ] When using a custom folder ID and you mirror files, it's okay BUT while mirroring a folder, every folder is going to be on the root ID you set up, not inside its respective parent folder. Kinda annoying thing...
- [ ] Needs to add a progress bar + remaining time
- [ ] `/ytdl` command is bugged out, needs fix due to yt-dl update
- [ ] Merge `/del` and `/delete` commands
- [ ] The `/emptytrash` command don't really works...
